# SARS-CoV-2 HaploGraph

[SARS-CoV-2 HaploGraph](https://ktym.github.io/covid19/) visualizes the emergence timing and geographical transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes from the 2nd to 5th epidemic waves in Japan using genome data obtained from GISAID as of June 4, 2022. For each epidemic wave, one ancestral haplotype was determined, and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes were shown for each prefecture in Japan by tracking nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions.
